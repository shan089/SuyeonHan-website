        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Suyeon Han and I am currently a 3rd year Political Science student. <br><br>

        Although I am just a college student, I am very well aware about how to code and many other things. I have graduated from both the FBI Teen Academy and the OCLEEAA Police Training course. <br><br>
        I am also a very quick learner and I can pretty much adapt to any type of environment. I am currently 21 years old and hoping to become an FBI Special Agent in either hostage rescue or investigation.
        I have gotten many inspiration to become a better person and a future Special Agent by an FBI head director in Los Angeles. 
        Right now I am a university student at University of California, Riverside. Although I was faced with many offers from different universities, I decided to take the offer from UCR because they have a very good political science class reputations. 
        Even though the field is pretty competitive and filled with very educated people, once you understand the dynamic of it, it is not that complicated. 
        I do not have many work experiences because I was only able to work for my father during high school and middle school. I helped with translating documents and speaking to his clients. 
        Two of my most proud accomplisments are that I have graduated from the FBI Teen Academy and the OCLEEAA Police Bootcamp. I also have a lot of volunteer hours because I worked for my city's police department and helped out with city events. 
        Although it does not sound like a lot, it was a lot of work dealing with helping my father, working on school and volunteering every week for my city's police department.
        The descrition of the police bootcamp can be found online as "CLEEAA and the Explorer Academy OCLEEAA is the Orange County Law Enforcement Explorer Advisorâ€™s Association, which is comprised of law enforcement agencies from Orange and Los Angeles counties. This association coordinates Explorer events throughout Orange County and sponsors the Explorer Academies and a yearly competition.
        The FBI Teen Academy's description can be found online as "Teen Academy program allows high school students an opportunity to get a comprehensive look into todayâ€™s FBI. Spend a day with current FBI employees learning about the many responsibilities of our organization. Students will learn various topics to possibly include the history of the FBI, terrorism, cyber crime, white collar crime, counterintelligence, evidence response, SWAT, violent crime, and behavioral analysis. Students will spend a day learning from the special agents, intelligence analysts, language specialists, and professional staff who work those violations. Applicants must be a current high school student age 16-18 with a GPA of 3.5 or higher. School activities and community outreach will be taken into consideration in the selection process.
        The FBI Teen Academy is highly selective and I was very surprised I met their requirments to be a part of their project. 
        I have moved to America in the beginning of 5th grade and passed my English fluency test in 3 years without even knowing the alphabet when I first came to America. I'm sure that was one of the reasons why I became a candidate for the FBI Teen Academy and got selected as one of their studnets.
